> ## Benchmarking the parallel performance
> Modify your job script to run on multiple cores and evaluate the performance of `sharpen`

> If you examine the log file you will see that it contains two timings: the total time taken by the
> entire program (including IO) and the time taken solely by the calculation. The image input
> and output is not parallelised so this is a serial overhead, performed by a single processor.
> The calculation part is, in theory, perfectly parallel (each processor operates on different parts
> of the image) so this should get faster on more cores. The IO time in the table below is the
> difference between the calculation time and the overall run time; the total core seconds is the
> *calculation time* multiplied by the number of cores.
